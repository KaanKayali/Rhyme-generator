# Rhyme-generator
A rhyme generator made in python with tkinter.

This is Rhyme generator!
Its made in python with the tkinter library.

Write a word for which you are looking for a rhyme in the text field.

If you are using this programme for the first time, youdo not yet have any words that could rhyme with the word you have typed. 

Add a list by clicking on ‘Add a list (txt)’ and selecting a text file from your explorer. The text file must contain words.

It is not required to follow a certain pattern in order to identify the words. It just finds every word.

If ‘Perfect rhyme’ is not selected, e and i as well as u and o are treated as the same letter in the rhyme.

it is easy to overhear the difference between the two letters, in a rap text. 

Try your hand at this program!

Thank you for using rhyme Generator :)
