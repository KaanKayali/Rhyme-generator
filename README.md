# Rhyme-generator
This is Rhyme generator!<br>
Its made in python with the tkinter library.

## How to use it
Write a word for which you are looking for a rhyme in the text field.

If you are using this programme for the first time, <br>
you do not yet have any words that could rhyme with the word you have typed. 

Add a list by clicking on ‘Add a list (txt)’ and selecting a text file from your explorer. <br>
The text file must contain words.

It is not required to follow a certain pattern in order to identify the words. <br>
It just finds every word.

If ‘Perfect rhyme’ is not selected, e and i as well as u and o <br>
are treated as the same letter in the rhyme. It is easy to overhear <br>
the difference between the two letters, in a rap text.

Try your hand at this program!

Thank you for using rhyme Generator :)
